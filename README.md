# AtliQ_Hospitality_Analysis
# Problem statement
Atliq Grands owns multiple five-star hotels across India. They have been in the hospitality industry for the past 20 years. Due to strategic moves from other competitors and ineffective decision-making in management, Atliq Grands are losing its market share and revenue in the luxury/business hotels category. As a strategic move, the managing director of Atliq Grands wanted to incorporate “Business and Data Intelligence” in order to regain their market share and revenue. However, they do not have an in-house data analytics team to provide them with these insights.

Their revenue management team had decided to hire a 3rd party service provider to provide them insights from their historical data.
# Business-Related Terms  

This project uses the following key business metrics and terms related to the hospitality industry:  

- **ADR (Average Daily Rate):**  
  The average revenue earned per available room per day.  

- **RevPAR (Revenue per Available Room):**  
  A performance metric calculated by dividing the total room revenue by the number of available rooms.  

- **DSRN (Daily Sellable Room Nights):**  
  The total number of room nights available for sale each day.  

- **DBRN (Daily Booked Room Nights):**  
  The total number of room nights booked each day.  

- **DURN (Daily Utilized Room Nights):**

# Data Modeling in Reporting  

Data modeling is the foundation of any report and plays a vital role in its success. All visuals and insights are built upon the data model. A well-structured data model ensures optimal report performance, while poor data modeling can negatively impact overall performance.  

## Data Modeling Approach  
In this project, we followed the **Star Schema** method for data modeling. This approach:  
- Simplifies the data structure.  
- Enhances query performance.  
- Makes it easier to build visuals and generate insights.  

By adopting the Star Schema, we ensured clarity, efficiency, and scalability for the report.
